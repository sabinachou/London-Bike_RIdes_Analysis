# London Bike Rides Analysis using Tableau  

## Project Overview  
Welcome to the **London Bike Rides Analysis** project repository! This project focuses on analyzing bike ride data in London, following a YouTube tutorial by **Mo Chen**. Using **Tableau**, I explored key insights into bike ride trends, including usage patterns, peak ride times, and weather conditions.

## Purpose  
The objective of this project is to analyze London bike rides and uncover insights such as:  
- **Moving average of bike rides**  
- **Bike usage patterns**  
- **Popular ride weather**  
- **Peak ride times**  

By visualizing the data in **Tableau**, I aimed to make these findings more accessible and easier to interpret.  

## 📂 Data Sources  
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains detailed information about bike rides in London, including:  
- **Ride duration**  
- **Start and end locations**  
- **Ride dates**  
- **Weather conditions**  

## 📌 Tableau Visualization  
The main visualization is built in **Tableau** and provides interactive insights into:  
- **Total rides over time**  
- **Moving average rides**  
- **Temperature and wind speed impact on rides**  
- **Peak ride hours**  
- **Popular ride weather conditions**
